# Instagram Media Extractor

Instagram Media Extractor is a web-based application built with Flask that allows you to extract and download media from Instagram profiles. Simply input a username, and the app fetches profile information and media posts in real time, allowing you to view and download images and videos directly.

## Features
- **Profile Overview**: Displays profile picture, username, full name, and follower count.
- **Media Extraction**: Fetches and displays all media posts (images and videos) from the given Instagram profile.
- **Download Media**: Allows you to download individual media items directly.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetches posts in real-time and shows loaded post count.

## How It Works
1. Enter an Instagram username in the search bar.
2. The app will start fetching media posts in real time.
